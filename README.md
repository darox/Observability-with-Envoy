# Observability with Envoy

A sandbox environment to play around with the three pillars of observability and traceID correlation. The observability completely happens in Envoy, no code instrumentation in the Flask Pythonn apps.

The environment consists of:
- Grafana
- Blackbox Exporter
- Prometheus
- Loki
- Promtail
- Zipkin
- Flask Python Apps
- Envoy proxy

In a real world scenario you would typically run this kind of environment on k8s. However, I wanted to keep it simple. That's why I have chosen Docker-Compose to spin up the environment.

## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Git
- Docker-Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
- Internet connectivity
- Time ðŸ˜‰

## Setup environment
1. Clone repo "git clone https://github.com/darox/Observability-with-Envoy"
2. Cd into folder "cd Observability-with-Envoy"
3. Start stack "docker-compose up" (to detach from terminal, just add â€“d flag)
4. Open webbrowser and go to 127:0.0.1 
 - :3000 (Grafana)
 - :9090 (Prometheus Server UI)
 - :9115 Blackbox Exporter Debug

Useful commands:
- docker-compose ps (to list containers)
- docker-compose logs (to show log of containers)
- docker-compose down (to stop the stack)
- docker-compose images (to show the used images)
- docker-compose up -d --build (to rebuild the stack and detach from terminal)
